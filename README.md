# Draw-Stable-Matching-and-School-Matching-

The Draw and Stable Matching Problem are the well studied problems in
the domain of mechanism design. In the Draw, we have multiple students
who are assigned rooms in dorms/houses. The objective is to make sure
that the students get a better choice of room than other methods. Talking
about stable matching, the objective is to assign students to colleges in a
way respectful of what everybody wants. It is assumed that the members of
the participating communities are strategic in nature.Given this setup, the
objective is to allocate each student and company a best possible match
from their revealed preference list.
The Student Matching Process involves implementation of experimental
study of systems used to allocate students by San Francisco elementary
school matching process. In this process, students are assigned to an
elementary school based on their preferences and with regards to a variety
of different factors.
